# smartsettings

## TBD list:
1. Project structure
    - ~~Having flow-striped source files causes problems with excluding flow containing files from esdoc documentation process. Move flow-striped sources to the `./docs` or separate directory, like `./no-flow` or `./flow-striped`.~~
    - Provide testing environment for unit and UI tests.
2. Core functionality
    - Provide stylesheets for `SmartSettings`:
        - suggested preprocessor: `sass` (bracket or indentation-driven notation)
    -
