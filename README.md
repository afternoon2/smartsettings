# smartsettings

## TBD list:
1. Project 
    - structure
        - ~~Having flow-striped source files causes problems with excluding flow containing files from esdoc documentation process. Move flow-striped sources to the `./docs` or separate directory, like `./no-flow` or `./flow-striped`.~~
        - ~~Provide testing structure and environment for unit tests.~~
    - build process
        - ~~Remove esdoc annotations and comments from the build files~~
        - ~~Add minified files~~
        - ~~Provide es6 module versions~~
2. Core functionality
    - Provide stylesheets for `SmartSettings`:
        - ~~suggested preprocessor: `sass` (bracket or indentation-driven notation)~~
        - ~~add autoprefixer~~
